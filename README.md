# NYC-subway-and-weather-data-analysis
We examine data related to the New York City Subway system
and weather conditions to determine if there is a correlation between
rainfall and subway ridership. Using statistical techniques and
visualization tools, we intend to arrive at a compelling conclusion based on the analyzed
dataset. We used the concept of MapReduce and its implementation using Python.
